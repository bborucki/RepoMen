Meeting 2 (Wed Jan 30): Got client.c and server.c working for
part6. Created a1-done branch for submission 

Explanation of getInput:
Takes input from the user, and places it in the globals struct.  It does
this by first zeroing the buffer (in.data and in.newline), and then reads
from stdin into in.data, returning a pointer to the the input string. If
no input, len = 0, else len = length of the input string. It then removes 
a newline character if present and sets in.newline = 1. Finally it returns
the length of the input.

Explanation of sendStr:
Takes a pointer to a string and writes first the length of the string and 
then the string itself to the server's file descriptor, effectively
sending it to the server.  The function then creates a buffer and reads 
the file descriptor into it, checking for length. If the length read into
the buffer is not the same as that of what was written to the file
descriptor, return -1, else write the buffer to stdout.

Explanation of pthread_create:
Server idles in infinite loop until a client connects to the server, at
which time the server creates a unique pthread for the client that
joined. The pthread gives the client the illusion that the client is
working one on one with the server, even though the server is possibly managing
several different clients at the same time.
